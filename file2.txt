Lonely, I am Mr. Lonely. I have nobody for my own.
Sailin' away on the crest of a wave
It's like magic
Oh, rollin' and ridin' and slippin' and slidin'
It's magic
And you, and your sweet desire
You took me higher and higher, baby
It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose..
Sometimes in our lives, we all have pain, we all have sorrow.
